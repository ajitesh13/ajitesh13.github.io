        As said by Blaise Pascal, "Clarity of minds means clarity of passion"
      </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      <P>
        One's passion make their life worth living. Inspired by this thought and
        taking into account the state of mental health in today's date, we
        decided to work on something that we would find amazing to use. What if
        you wanted to remember how you felt a week or two ago? What if you want
        to know what crossed your mind then?

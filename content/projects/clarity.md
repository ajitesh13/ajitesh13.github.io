## "Clarity of minds means clarity of passion"

As said by Blaise Pascal, "Clarity of minds means clarity of passion". One's passion make their life worth living. Inspired by this thought and taking into account the state of mental health in today's date, we decided to work on something that we would find amazing to use.

What if you wanted to remember how you felt a week or two ago? What if you want to know what crossed your mind then? Clarity allows you to pen down something, anything. Follow your emotions, just don't hesitate to dive deep down into it.

## How does it work?

It's simple! Follow these steps:

1. Visit the app and you can pen down something, anything.
2. Follow your emotions, just don't hesitate to dive deep down into it.
3. Write down your emotions truly and that's it!
4. Click on submit and it will be stored as a little secret between us.
5. Want to know about your state of your mind few days back? Don't worry we will show you.
6. Want to share it with someone else or your therapist? We have that too!

## Tech Stack

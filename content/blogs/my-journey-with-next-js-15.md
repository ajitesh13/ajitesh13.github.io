Next.js 15 has been a game-changer for my projects. The combination of the App Router, React Server Components, and Turbopack has significantly improved both developer experience and application performance.

## The App Router Revolution

Moving from the Pages Router to the App Router was initially daunting, but the benefits quickly became apparent. The new layout system makes it incredibly easy to share UI between routes, and the streaming capabilities with Suspense boundaries have dramatically improved perceived performance.

## Turbopack: Speed Redefined

The development experience with Turbopack is noticeably faster. Hot module replacement is nearly instantaneous, and the build times have been cut in half. This has made the development workflow much more enjoyable and productive.

## React 19 Integration

With Next.js 15, we get full support for React 19 features. The new hooks and improved concurrent rendering capabilities open up new possibilities for building complex, performant applications.

## Key Takeaways

- App Router provides better code organization and performance
- Turbopack significantly improves development speed
- React Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
- Streaming with Suspense improves user experience
- TypeScript support is first-class and seamless

## Conclusion

Upgrading to Next.js 15 has been one of the best decisions for my projects. The improved performance, better developer experience, and modern architecture make it an excellent choice for building web applications in 2025.

If you're still on an older version of Next.js, I highly recommend making the jump. The migration guide is comprehensive, and the benefits are well worth the effort.

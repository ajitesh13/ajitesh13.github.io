An incredible book that changed how I think about productivity and self-improvement. James Clear presents a practical framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones.

The concept of atomic habits - tiny changes that compound over time - resonates deeply with software development. Just like refactoring code incrementally leads to better architecture, small daily improvements lead to remarkable results.

What I loved most is the actionable advice. The Four Laws of Behavior Change provide a clear blueprint for habit formation that actually works in practice.

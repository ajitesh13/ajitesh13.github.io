A beautiful spring morning capturing the ephemeral beauty of cherry blossoms. The soft pink petals against the blue sky created a magical atmosphere that I tried to capture in these shots.

Walking through the parks during sakura season is always a humbling experience - a reminder of nature's beauty and the fleeting moments we should cherish.

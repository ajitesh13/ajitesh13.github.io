Walking through the traditional machiya houses of Kyoto feels like stepping back in time. These wooden townhouses, with their distinctive latticed windows and narrow facades, represent centuries of Japanese architectural tradition.

The early morning light filtering through the narrow streets creates a serene atmosphere perfect for photography. Each house tells a story of craftsmanship and cultural heritage.
